# üçû Multithreaded Bakery Simulation

A comprehensive C++ simulation of two bakery models (single-baker and multi-baker) using POSIX threads (pthreads), mutexes, condition variables, and semaphores to study parallel processing efficiency in a real-world scenario.

## üìñ Project Overview
This project simulates two bakery models as described in the PP-CA3-Fall03 assignment:
1. **Single-baker bakery (Takpaz)**: One baker serving one queue of customers
2. **Multi-baker bakery (Chandpaz)**: Multiple bakers (2 to N, where N is system cores) each with their own customer queue, sharing a common oven

The simulation compares performance metrics (average/standard deviation of order-to-delivery time) between both models under different conditions, including a "chaos mode" where customers compete for baker attention.

## üöÄ Key Features
- Thread-based simulation of bakers, customers, and shared resources
- Three synchronization models:
  - `single_baker.cpp`: Traditional producer-consumer with one baker
  - `multi_baker.cpp`: Multiple producer-consumer systems with shared oven
  - `chaos.cpp`: Competitive customer model without orderly queues
- Performance metrics collection for order processing times
- Configurable parameters:
  - Oven capacity (max breads = 10 √ó baker count)
  - Baking time (2 minutes per bread)
  - Maximum order size (15 breads per customer)

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Execution

### Prerequisites
- Linux system
- g++ (supporting C++20)
- pthread library

### Compilation
```sh
g++ -std=c++20 -pthread -o bakery main.cpp single_baker.cpp multi_baker.cpp chaos.cpp
```

### Execution Modes
1. **Single-baker mode**:
   ```sh
   ./bakery single < input_single.txt
   ```
   Input format:
   - Line 1: Customer names (space-separated)
   - Line 2: Bread counts per customer (matching name order)

2. **Multi-baker mode**:
   ```sh
   ./bakery multi < input_multi.txt
   ```
   Input format:
   - Line 1: Number of bakers (N)
   - Next N√ó2 lines: For each baker:
     - Customer names (space-separated)
     - Bread counts per customer

3. **Chaos mode** (multi-baker with competitive customers):
   ```sh
   ./bakery chaos < input_multi.txt
   ```

## üìä Performance Analysis
The program outputs:
- Average order-to-delivery time per bread
- Standard deviation of delivery times
- Comparison between orderly queue vs. chaos mode
- Scaling analysis with varying baker counts

## üîß Implementation Details
- Synchronization primitives:
  - Mutexes for oven and delivery space access
  - Condition variables for baker-customer notification
  - Semaphores for oven capacity management
- Timer handling using `timer_create()` and `timer_settime()`
- Signal-safe global variables for timer callbacks
- Thread-safe data structures for order tracking

## üéØ Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:
- POSIX thread management
- Advanced synchronization with mutexes and condition variables
- Resource contention in shared systems (oven)
- Performance analysis of parallel systems
- Real-world system modeling with producer-consumer patterns
